# PracticeTerraform

This repository serves as my IaC for brushing up my Terraform skills (and ancillary skills like Hashicorp Vault etc.) and validating that my extensive knowledge in Azure Bicep, Azure Infrastructure and general IaC concepts are transferable to Terraform.  
I'm making this public for two main reasons;
- In the hope that if I need to demonstrate my knowledge and skills I can reference this repository.
- If someone learning these tools desires more examples they can learn from this.
